### ToDo: 
#### Today’s main objectives: Reviewing and practicing Git
- Fork this repo on GitHub
- Clone your forked repo to your local environment 
- make edits to The README.md file, commit, and push changes
- After pushing, create a branch when you make more changes to the repo 
- Push the changes that you made on your branch 
- On GitHub, create a pr and merge the branch to main 
- on your local repo pull the updated version of main

#### Notes 

`git status`: Shows what changes you've made to the files you created.

`git add`: Adds the files that the user wants to commit to the repository. In other words it lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit.

`git commit`: The process by which you document the changes made to your repository

`git push`:  Pushes your local commit history into a remote repository
